Write a simple function to mask the Bank Account Number

Function is expected to take in 4 parameters.
bankAccountNumber – original string to be masked (e.g. “101-76074-5”)
maskedWith – character to replace for masking (e.g. ‘*’)
ignoredChar – character to ignore (e.g. ‘-‘)
remainingChar – character to retain without masking (e.g. 5)

Below table illustrates the expected outcome:
Bank Account Number     Masked Bank Account Number
101-76074-5             ***-*6074-5
356-5-5059302           ***-*-**59302
78-19084-84             **-**084-84
1875-2788-9-008-1       ****-***-9-008-1
